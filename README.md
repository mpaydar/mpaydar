### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mohammad Bayat. I am a current graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I started my computer science degree at Stony Brook where I learned my funamental coding skills. Then, I moved to Queens College where I got my Computer Science Bachelor. If you ask me,which programming languages you have learned so far, my answer would be : Python,JavaScript,C/C++, and Java. My expertise is in Python and JavaScript because I have done so many coding projects and assignments in these two languages. However, I believe if one wants to be a good coder, he needs to study low level coding languages for few years. That's why I studied C++ for almost 2 years alone without touching any other languages. I have deep understanding of memory managament schemes and what is happening behind high level languages such as python and JavaScript. Lastly, even though I am more comforable in python and JavaScript, but if you ask me to code in C/C++ I can definitly get as good as I am in Python and JavaScript very quickly.

Feel free to look at my coding profile which include both personal and school projects that I have done over the past few years.
